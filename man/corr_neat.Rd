\usage{
corr_neat(var1, var2, ci = 0.95, bf_added = TRUE, direction = NULL,
  round_r = 3, for_table = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{var1}{Numeric vector; numbers of the first variable.}

\item{var2}{Numeric vector; numbers of the second variable.}

\item{ci}{Numeric; confidence level for the returned CI, as implemented in
\code{\link[stats]{cor.test}}.}

\item{bf_added}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), Bayes factor is calculated
and displayed.}

\item{direction}{\code{NULL} or string; optionally specifies one-sided test:
either "negative" (negative correlation expected) or "positive" (positive
correlation expected). (Short forms also work, e.g. "p", "pos", "neg", etc.)
If \code{NULL} (default), the test is two-sided.}

\item{round_r}{Number \code{\link[=ro]{to round}} to the correlation and its
CI.}

\item{for_table}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, omits the confidence level display
from the printed text.}
}
\value{
Prints correlation statistics (including CI and BF) in APA style.
 Furthermore, when assigned, returns a named vector with the following
 elements: \code{r} (Pearson correlation), \code{p} (p value), \code{bf}
 (Bayes factor).
}
\description{
\code{\link[stats:cor.test]{Pearson correlation}} results
 including confidence interval (CI) and correlation
 \code{\link[BayesFactor:correlationBF]{Bayes factor}} (BF).
}
\details{
The Bayes factor (BF) is always calculated with the default r-scale of
\code{0.707}. BF supporting null hypothesis is denoted as BF01, while that
supporting alternative hypothesis is denoted as BF10. When the BF is smaller
than 1 (i.e., supports null hypothesis), the reciprocal is calculated (hence,
BF10 = BF, but BF01 = 1/BF). When the BF is greater than or equal to 10000,
scientific (exponential) form is reported for readability. (The original full
BF number is available in the returned named vector as \code{bf}.)
}
\note{
The correlation and CI is calculated via
\code{\link[stats:cor.test]{stats::cor.test}}.

The Bayes factor is calculated via
\code{\link[BayesFactor:correlationBF]{BayesFactor::correlationBF}}.

# assign two variables
v1 = c(11, 15, 19, 43, 53, -4, 34, 8, 33, -1, 54 )
v2 = c(4, -2, 23, 13, 32, 16, 3, 29, 37, -4, 65 )

corr_neat(v1, v2) # prints statistics

# one-sided, and omitting the "95\% CI" part
corr_neat(v1, v2, direction = 'pos', for_table = TRUE)

# print statistics and assign main results
results = corr_neat(v1, v2, direction = 'pos')

results['p'] # get precise p value
